# dEncryptor
dEncryptor is a simple encryption python application built using tkinter and the cryptography module.

## Usage

### Encryption
Choose a file and press the encrypt button. A key will automatically be generated. Select it or use the copy button to add it to your clipboard.

### Decryption
